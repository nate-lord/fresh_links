## Introduction

Fresh links is a cloud-based RSS reader. The userâ€™s posts appear in a timeline and are stripped free of ads, superfluous HTML, and with their full text. The articles can be automatically deleted after some amount of time has passed (to prevent inbox build up), listed in the timeline indefinitely, or saved into a separate section.

## Basic user flow

The user selects one of the following combinations in generating their online document:

* Two sources the input into text fields.
* Two pre-published sources by other authors (ex: text from craigslist rants and raves and Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov.)
* An text-inputed source and a pre-published source.
* No sources. This creates a blank doc.

If the user selects multiple sources the texts are folded together, one line from one source, the next from the other.

An optional title and password (allowing the page to be locked) can be added.

The user transitions to the new document. There the user can manipulate the document as one could with a pared-down OpenOffice text document.
